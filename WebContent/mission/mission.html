							In the era of data-intensive scientific discovery, Big Data scientists in all communities spend the majority of 
							their time and effort collecting, integrating, curating, transforming, and assessing quality before actually 
							performing discovery analysis. Some endeavors may even start from information not being available and accessible 
							in digital form, and when it is available, it is often in non-structured form, not compatible with analytics tools 
							that require structured and uniformly-formatted data. Two main methods to deal with the volume and variety of data 
							as well as to accelerate the rate of digitization have been to apply crowdsourcing or machine-learning solutions. 
							However, very little has been done to simultaneously take advantage of both types of solutions, and to make it 
							easier for different efforts to share and reuse developed software elements. The vision of the Human- and 
							Machine-Intelligent Network (HuMaIN) project is to <b>accelerate scientific data digitization through fundamental 
							advances in the integration and mutual cooperation between human and machine processing</b> in order to handle 
							practical hurdles and bottlenecks present in scientific data digitization. Even though HuMaIN concentrates on 
							digitization tasks faced by the biodiversity community, the software elements being developed are generic in 
							nature, and expected to be <b>applicable to other scientific domains</b> (e.g., exploring the surface of the moon 
							for craters require the same type of crowdsourcing tool as finding words in text, and the same questions of whether 
							machine-learning tools could provide similar results can be tested).
							<br/><br/>
							The HuMaIN project proposes to conduct research and develop the following software elements:<br/>
							<ol>
								<li>
									<b>Configurable Machine-Learning applications for scientific data digitization</b> (e.g., Optical Character 
									Recognition and Natural Language Processing), which will be made automatically <u>available as RESTful 
									services</u> for increasing the ability of HuMaIN software elements to interoperate with other elements 
									while decreasing the software development time via a new application specification language
								</li>
								<li>
									<b>Workflows leading to a cyber-human coordination system</b> that will take advantage of feedback loops 
									(e.g., based on consensus of crowdsourced data and its quality) for self-adaptation to changes and 
									increased sustainability of the overall system
								</li>
								<li>
									New <b>crowdsourcing micro-tasks</b> with ability of being <u>reusable</u> for a variety of scenarios and 
									<u>containing user activity sensors</u> for studying time-effective user interfaces
								</li>
								<li>
									Services to <b>support automated creation and configuration of crowdsourcing workflows</b> on demand to fit 
									the needs of individual groups. 
								</li>
							</ol> 
							A <b>cloud-based</b> system will be deployed to provide the necessary execution environment with traceability 
							of service executions involved in cyber-human workflows, and cost-effectiveness analysis of all the software 
							elements 
							developed in this project will provide assessment and evaluation of long standing what-if scenarios pertaining 
							human- and machine-intelligent tasks. Crowdsourcing activities will attract a wide range of users with tasks 
							that require low expertise, and at the same time it will expose volunteers to applied science and engineering, 
							potentially attracting interest of K-12 teachers and students.
